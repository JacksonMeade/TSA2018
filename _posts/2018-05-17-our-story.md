### About the Technology Student Association
## LEARNING TO LEAD IN A TECHNICAL WORLD




#### Who are TSA Members?

The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national organization of students engaged in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Open to students enrolled in or who have completed technology education courses, TSA’s membership includes over 250,000 middle and high school students in approximately 2,000 schools spanning 48 states. TSA is supported by educators, parents and business leaders who believe in the need for a technologically literate society. Members learn through exciting competitive events, leadership opportunities and much more. The diversity of activities makes TSA a positive experience for every student. From engineers to business managers, our alumni credit TSA with a positive influence on their lives.

#### Chapters
TSA chapters take the study of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) beyond the classroom and give students the chance to pursue academic challenges among friends with similar goals and interests. Together, chapter members work on competitive events, attend conferences on the state and national levels and have a good time raising funds to get there. Chapter organization develops leadership, as members may become officers within their state and then run nationally. Our chapters are committed to a national service project and are among the most service-oriented groups in the community.

#### To Start a TSA Chapter

All that is needed is a motivated teacher and an eager group of students. An expensive array of high-tech equipment is not necessary. Just call [703-860-9000]({{ "tel:7038609000" }}) or click on Join TSA for more information.


#### Competitions

Imagine an activity so captivating that your students spend hours working on it after school for weeks at a time. That’s what happens when TSA members engage in TSA’s competitions. Only TSA members have the opportunity to compete at exciting state conferences and then at the annual National Conference. Expert judging by technology educators and industry representatives inspires the best from participants. Members are rewarded not only with medals or trophies, but also with memories of the camaraderie and the challenge of a national TSA conference.

#### Meeting STEM Criteria Through TSA Participation

Education directives at the federal and state levels focus on providing avenues for initiatives such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. TSA helps teachers meet the criteria for STEM education goals through exciting programs that include technology activities, competitions, leadership, and teamwork for students. In addition, all TSA activities are correlated to the Standards for Technological Literacy, as set forth by the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA). Teachers can use TSA’s activities during the school day in their classroom and extend the learning beyond the classroom through a TSA chapter.

#### Middle School and High School Level

Students can work individually or as a team in such areas as agriculture and biotechnology, website design, dragster design, flight challenge, film technology, CAD with 3D modeling, desktop publishing, extemporaneous speaking, radio controlled transportation, or scientific visualization.
