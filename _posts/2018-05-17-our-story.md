### About the Technology Student Association
## LEARNING TO LEAD IN A TECHNICAL WORLD


#### Who are TSA Members?

The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national organization of students engaged in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Open to students enrolled in or who have completed technology education courses, TSAâ€™s membership includes over 250,000 middle and high school students in approximately 2,000 schools spanning 48 states. TSA is supported by educators, parents and business leaders who believe in the need for a technologically literate society. Members learn through exciting competitive events, leadership opportunities and much more. The diversity of activities makes TSA a positive experience for every student. From engineers to business managers, our alumni credit TSA with a positive influence on their lives.

#### Chapters
TSA chapters take the study of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) beyond the classroom and give students the chance to pursue academic challenges among friends with similar goals and interests. Together, chapter members work on competitive events, attend conferences on the state and national levels and have a good time raising funds to get there. Chapter organization develops leadership, as members may become officers within their state and then run nationally. Our chapters are committed to a national service project and are among the most service-oriented groups in the community.

#### To Start a TSA Chapter
All that is needed is a motivated teacher and an eager group of students. An expensive array of high-tech equipment is not necessary. Just call 703-860-9000 or click on Join TSA for more information.
